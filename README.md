# phpMyXBMC  
This is an early version of a website GUI for viewing movies/shows and stats about your XBMC library when exported to MySQL.  

This will only work with newer browsers with support for the latest versions of CSS and HTML. 
So if you are using Internet Explorer this won't work (and even if it would work you should not use that browser anyway).

## Languages and stuff used  
> PHP  
> HTML (version 4 and 5)  
> CSS3  
> LESS CSS  
> PDO MySQL  
> jQuery  
> Normalize CSS from HTML5 Boilerplate  

## ToDo  
* The DB connection  
* Everything else ;)
