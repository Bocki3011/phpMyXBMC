# phpMyXBMC  
This is an early version of a web application for viewing movies/shows and stats about your XBMC library when exported to MySQL.  

This will only work with newer browsers with support for the latest versions of CSS and HTML.
So if you are using Internet Explorer this won't work (and even if it would work you shouldn't use IE anyway).  

## Languages and stuff used  
> PHP with PDO  
> HTML5  
> CSS3  
> LESS CSS  
> MySQL  
> jQuery
